HybridUrb: a Python package to perform hybrid urban flood modelling
===================================================================

HybridUrb is a python package to build and run simplified 1D models for urban flood nowcasting using hybrid method proposed by `Li & Willems (2022)`_.

HybridUrb is a package under development. The current version only support using the package to run a pre-calibrated HybridUrb model in nowcast mode.
